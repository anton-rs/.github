#### [Anton Systems](https://anton.systems) - A Hub to Contribute to the Rust OP Stack.

The [alldevs](https://github.com/anton-rs/alldevs) repository is where all project management, specifications, and otherwise Rust OP Stack related content is tracked.

To improve or build ontop of the Rust OP Stack, read through the [alldevs](https://github.com/anton-rs/alldevs) repo first. If you're looking to build a new project, we will create a repository that **you** can spearhead inside the [anton-rs](https://github.com/anton-rs) github org once your project spec is added to [alldevs](https://github.com/anton-rs/alldevs).

#### Operating Principles

[Anton Systems](https://anton.systems) developers operate under a few principles.

- The software that we build is the software that we use.
- There must be no expectation for preferential treatment. All open source contributions in this github org are done in good faith and for the public benefit.
- The dynamic nature of decentralized systems requires a first-principles approach.
- _All our rust are belong to you._

An open form chat room for [Anton Systems](https://anton.systems) is available on [Telegram](https://t.me/+Ig4WDWOzikA3MzA0).
