[Anton Systems](https://anton.systems) is a open-source research collective with a mission to build high quality software
for large scale decentralized systems. Contributors will be elected retroactively based on their overall contributions. That said, the intent is to be as open and accessible as possible while maintaining high level of rigor.

We operate under a few principles:

- The software that we build is the software that we use.
- There is no expectation for preferential treatment.
- The dynamic nature of decentralized systems often requires a first-principles approach.
- _All our rust are belong to you._

[anton-rs](https://github.com/anton-rs/) is the selected name for our Github Organization to make explicit our preference
to build robust software in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). All of our code, architectures, and otherwise intellectual
property is developed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) with the exception of external adaptations or "forks". We strongly encourage and elicit feedback.

We currently work on and have developed or helped develop:
* [op-reth](https://github.com/refcell/reth): Support for [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) in the [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) execution client.
* [magi](https://github.com/a16z/magi): An OP Stack rollup client built in rust providing the same functionality as the [op-node](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-node).

_h/t to [Paradigm](https://github.com/paradigmxyz) for the README setup._
