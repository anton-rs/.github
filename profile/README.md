#### [Anton Systems](https://anton.systems) - A Hub to Contribute to the Rust OP Stack.

The [alldevs](https://github.com/anton-rs/alldevs) repository is where all project management, specifications, and otherwise Rust OP Stack related content is tracked.

This organization is owned by **you**, contributors to the Optimism Collective and developers of the OP Stack.

To jump in, read through the [alldevs](https://github.com/anton-rs/alldevs) repo. If you're looking to build a new project, [anton-rs](https://github.com/anton-rs) organization owners will create a repository inside the org that **you** can spearhead once your project spec is added to [alldevs](https://github.com/anton-rs/alldevs).

#### Operating Principles

[Anton Systems](https://anton.systems) operates under a few principles.

- The software that we build is the software that we use.
- There must be no expectation for preferential treatment. All open source contributions in this github org are done in good faith and for the public benefit.
- The dynamic nature of decentralized systems requires a first-principles approach.
- _All our rust are belong to you._

An open form chat room for [Anton Systems](https://anton.systems) is available on [Telegram](https://t.me/+XR8_p3qjzoFiMjEx).
