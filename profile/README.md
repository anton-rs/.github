[anton-rs](https://anton.vercel.app/) is a open-source research collective with a mission to build high quality software
for large scale decentralized systems. Membership is informally selective and maximally efficient.

We take a first-principles approach for building new software given the extreme dynamic nature of decentralized
environments. That said, we develop our own software we enjoy using and make no claims to a neutral preference.

[anton-rs](https://anton.vercel.app/) is the selected name for our Github Organization to demonstrate our preference
to build robust software in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). All of our code, architectures, and otherwise intellectual
property is developed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/). We illicite feedback but make no
guarantees for changes.

We currently work on and have developed or helped develop:
* [op-reth](https://github.com/refcell/reth): Support for [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) in the [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) execution client.
* [magi](https://github.com/a16z/magi): An OP Stack rollup client built in rust providing the same functionality as the [op-node](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-node).
