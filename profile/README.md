#### [Anton Systems](https://anton.systems) - A Hub to Contribute to the Rust OP Stack.

[alldevs](https://github.com/anton-rs/alldevs) is where all project management, specs, rfcs, and otherwise Rust OP Stack related content is tracked.

If you want to build the or on the Rust OP Stack, read through the [alldevs](https://github.com/anton-rs/alldevs) repo. If you're looking to build something new, we will create a repository that **you** can own inside the [anton-rs](https://github.com/anton-rs) github org once your project spec is added to [alldevs](https://github.com/anton-rs/alldevs).

#### Operating Principles

[Anton Systems](https://anton.systems) developers operate under a few principles.

- The software that we build is the software that we use.
- There must be no expectation for preferential treatment. All open source contributions in this github org are done in good faith and for the public benefit.
- The dynamic nature of decentralized systems requires a first-principles approach.
- _All our rust are belong to you._

#### Licensing

All code, designs, and otherwise intellectual property is developed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) unless
otherwise explicitly expressed in **both** the project specification and project repository.
