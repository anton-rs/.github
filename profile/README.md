[Anton Systems](https://anton.systems) is a open-source research collective with a mission to build high quality software
for large scale decentralized systems. The intent is to be as open and accessible as possible while maintaining high level of rigor.

We operate under a few principles:

- The software that we build is the software that we use.
- There is no expectation for preferential treatment.
- The dynamic nature of decentralized systems requires a first-principles approach.
- _All our rust are belong to you._

To maintain a high level of rigor, we build all our software in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
All of our code, designs, and otherwise intellectual property is developed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) unless otherwise explicitly stated.
Feedback is strongly urged and elicited.

We currently work on and have developed or helped develop:
* [op-reth](https://github.com/anton-rs/op-reth): Support for the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) in the [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth) execution client.
* [op-revm](https://github.com/anton-rs/op-revm): Support for the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) in [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm).
* [magi](https://github.com/a16z/magi): An OP Stack rollup client built in rust providing the same functionality as the [op-node](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/op-node).
